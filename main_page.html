			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
				language.
				Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
				its
				environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
			<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
				language
				elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
				variety
				of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
					Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
					elements
					on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
				</li>
				<li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
					on
					a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
					provide
					continuations of the execution of a script, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
				<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
				<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
					<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">JavaScript
						basics</a> to learn the basics of programming and JavaScript.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It also helps to have the following application software installed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that can edit plain text.</li>
				<li>A recent version of a web browser such as Firefox or Chrome.</li>

			<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
				following
				table highlights the main differences between the two languages:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>JavaScript</th>
					<th>Java</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</td>
					<td>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>JavaScript is designed for creating network-centric applications.</td>
					<td>Java is designed to be a "write once, run anywhere" language.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>JavaScript is complementary to and integrated with HTML.</td>
					<td>Java is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that
						compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
						recompilation.

					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>JavaScript has object-oriented capabilities that allow you to build interactivity into otherwise
						static HTML pages.</td>

			<header>
				<h1 id="Hello_world">Hello world</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Let's start with a simple example. The following code displays "Hello World" in an alert box:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert("Hello World");</code></pre>
			<p>Save the code above in a file named "hello.js" and open it in a browser. You should see an alert box
				that
				says "Hello World".</p>
			<p>Try it yourself Â»</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
			<header>
				<h1 id="Variables">Variables</h1>
			</header>
			<p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
			<p>In this example, x, y, and z, are variables:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;</code></pre>
			<p>JavaScript uses the keyword <code>var</code> to declare a variable.</p>
			<p>After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of
				<code>undefined</code>).
				To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x = 5;</code></pre>
			<p>Now x has the value of 5.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is a <strong>dynamically typed</strong> language. This means that the same variable can be
				used
				to hold different data types:</p>
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">var x; // Now x is undefined
x = 5; // Now x is a Number
x = "John"; // Now x is a String</code></pre>
			<p>JavaScript uses the keyword <code>let</code> to declare a variable.</p>
			<p>After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of
				<code>undefined</code>).
				To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">let x = 5;</code></pre>
			<p>Now x has the value of 5.</p>

			<pre><code class="language-javascript">let x; // Now x is undefined
x = 5; // Now x is a Number
x = "John"; // Now x is a String</code></pre>
			<p>JavaScript uses the keyword <code>const</code> to declare a variable.</p>
			<p>After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it has the value of
				<code>undefined</code>).
